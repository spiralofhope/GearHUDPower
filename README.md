GearHUD is now dragable and resizable!

# GearHUDPower

GearHUDPower is a World of Warcraft AddOn (Lua).

It is a hackish modification of "warbaby's":http://www.curseforge.com/profiles/warbaby/ AddOn "GearHUD":http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/gear_hud/ to show power instead of health.

It simulates the Gears of War cog/skull health indicator, but for power.

GearHUD and GearHUDPower can both run at the same time.

@GEAR_HUD_POWER.tga@ is derived from EPIC game Gears of War.

# Customization

Find your AddOn installation location, (maybe @C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\@), and edit @GearHudPower.lua@ to make changes.

  GEAR_HUD_THRESH_HOLD = { 60, 40, 25, 10, 0 };
  GEAR_HUD_OFFSET = {0, 130}

# Usage

- @/gearhud@ or @/gh@ to lock/unlock.
- @/gearhud@ or @/gh reset@ to reset to default.
- Right-click the resize handler to lock.
